### :pineapple: Testing

- Unit test — evaluates the smallest possible unit of testable code, such as a single function.
- Integration test — evaluates how the units of a particular program work with one another.
- Acceptance test — evaluates whether the user experience aligns with the business requirements of the software.
- End-to-end test — evaluates the application’s behavior using production-like infrastructure that includes networking, databases, and calls to external APIs.
