<!--General-->
### :cherries: General File Info
UNIX is commonly described as an system where "everything is file". If it isn't a file, it is a process. These files are also case sensitive. This section will describe some of the GNU/Linux's most important files.

Here are some special exceptions to our famous rule:
- **Directories**
- **Special Files**
- **Links**
- **Domain Sockets**
- **Named Pipes**

<!--Process_Types-->
### :tangerine: Shell Initialization Files
###### Two Categories of Startup Files
- **System-wide**
  - _/etc/profiles_
  - _/etc/bashrc_
- **User-specific**

###### Background and Foreground Job Processing
- **Foreground Process** = Commands run through an interactive shell (ex. gnome-terminal) are foreground processes by default. This means the administrator must wait for the command to complete before issuing a new one.
- **Background Process** = Background processes will be executed at a lower priority and be ran in the background as a job. This allows administrators to run commands within the same interactive shell while the job is running.

Running a command as a _Background Process_:
```
$ command &
```

## :white_circle: *Inodes, Hard links, and Soft links*
  <!-- Inodes -->
#### :small_blue_diamond: [Inodes](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inode.7.html)
<p>Each file has an inode containing metadata about the file. An application can retrieve this metadata using the stat command. The stat command can provide the file system information when we provide file name with the -f (â€“file-system) option.</p>

```
stat -f filename
```
<p>Here is the information we retrieve from the stat command:</p>

<!-- stat command -->
- File: The name of provided file.
- ID: FIle system ID in hexadecimal.
- Namelen: The maximum length (number of char) of a file name.
- Fundamental block size: Total size of each block on the file system.
- Blocks:
   - Total: Total number of blocks in the file system.
   - Free: Total number of free blocks in the file system.
   - Available: Total number of free blocks available for non-root users.
- Inodes:
   - Total: Total number of inodes in the file system.
   - Free: Total number of free inodes in the file system.
  <!-- Hard/Soft Links -->
##### :small_orange_diamond: [Hard links & Symbolic Links](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-symbolic-links-in-linux-using-the-ln-command/)

<!-- Hard link -->
##### [Hard link]
<p>Creating a hard link creates another name for the same data on disk. File names simply point to some data on a system's disk.</p>
<!-- Symlink -->

##### [Symbolic link]
<p>
Soft link is a pointer to a file name. Real file name points to data on disk:
  - Removing symbolic link won't delete original file.
  - Removing file will create a broken symlink.
  - Able to point to objects on different filesystems, partitions, and/or disks.
</p>

```
[NAME]
ln - make links between files

[OPTIONS]
-s, --symbolic
    make symbolic links instead of hard links
    
-t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links
```

  <!-- File Streams -->
#### :small_blue_diamond: Standard File Streams
Stream | Symbolic Name | Value | Default
:------ |:------:|:------:|:------:
Standard Input | stdin | 0 | Keyboard
Standard Output | stdout | 1 | Terminal
Standard Error | stderr | 2 | Log File

#### :small_orange_diamond: I/O Redirection
- Change input source of ***filename*** to "input-file"
```
filename < input-file
```
- Configure output of ***filename*** (stdout) to "output-file"
```
filename > output-file
```
- Configure error output of ***filename*** (stderr) to "error-file"
```
filename 2> error-file
```
- Configure standard output & error of ***filename*** to "output-file"
```
filename >& error-file
```
#### :small_blue_diamond: Find Command
```
[NAME]
find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

[OPTIONS]
-type f               # File
-type b               # Block
-type s               # Socket
-type d               # Directory
-type l               # Symlink

-atime                # Last accessed/read of inode metadata (file ownership, permissions, etc.)
-ctime                # Last change of inode metadata (file ownership, permissions, etc.)

-size 256k            # Exactly 256KiB 
-size -128c           # Smaller than 128 bytes
-size +5G             # Larger than 2GiB

-exec command {} \;   # Executes "command" on find
```
