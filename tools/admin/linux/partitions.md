Here are some of the most commonly used commands for process monitoring:
- ps = Displays process statistics in a snapshot. (Scripts, Extracting Data to Pipelines, etc.)
- top = Displays process statistics continuously. (Real-time Anaylsis)

1. For a Snapshot of Linux processes, use the [ps](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html) command:
```
[NAME]
  ps - report a snapshot of current processes.
  
[USAGE]
  $ ps [options]
  
[SORT PROCESSES]
  -a        # Display all processes on a terminal, with exception of group leaders.
  -f        # Display a full listing.
  -elf      # Display one line of info for every thread.
```

2. For displaying Real-time Linux processes, use the [top](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html) command:
```
[NAME]
  top - display Linux processes
  
[USAGE]
  $ top [options]
  
[SORT PROCESSES]
  (M)       # Sort by the Memory Percentage (%MEM) column.
  (N)       # Sort by the PID (Process ID) column.
  (T)       # Sort by TIME+ column
  (P)       # Sort by the CPU Percentage (%CPU) column.
```
